   Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?

Connecting RV owners to landowners to park their RV on, and the landowners to make a little cash off of their unused land.


- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem? 


Shows available land for RV owners to park on, giving more options than the limited space at traditional RV parks. The app gives detailed information about the land including location, rate, and amenities, and allows filtering and reservations.

	Allows landowners to connect with RVers easily by facilitating reservations.

- What is the mission statement? 
5th wheel Airbnb is a company that connects land owners and RV owners.  RV parks are often cramped and in many areas are booked months in advance. Collectively, landowners hold vast swaths of unused land that could be earning them revenue.  By using 5th wheel Airbnb, RV Owners get  access to use these previously unknown/unavailable sites, and Landowners get to cash in on otherwise dormant or underutilized land.

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
